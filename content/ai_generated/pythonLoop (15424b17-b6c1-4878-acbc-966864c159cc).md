# Python Loop

Loop in Python: This example demonstrates a basic for loop that iterates through a sequence of numbers.

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

This code will print numbers from 0 to 9, one per line. The `range(10)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9, and the loop iterates over each number, printing it.
