# Printing in Ruby

Ruby provides several methods for outputting text to the console. This document covers the most common ways to print in Ruby, including `puts`, `print`, `p`, string interpolation, and formatted output.

## Using `puts`

The `puts` method is the most commonly used method for printing in Ruby. It adds a newline character at the end of the output.

```ruby
puts "Hello, World!"
```

Output:

```text
Hello, World!
```

## Using `print`

The `print` method is similar to `puts`, but it does not add a newline character at the end.

```ruby
print "Hello, "
print "World!"
```

Output:

```text
Hello, World!
```

## Using `p`

The `p` method is useful for debugging as it shows a more "raw" representation of objects.

```ruby
p "Hello, World!"
p [1, 2, 3]
```

Output:

```text
"Hello, World!"
[1, 2, 3]
```

## Using string interpolation

You can use string interpolation to include variables or expressions within a string:

```ruby
name = "Alice"
age = 30
puts "My name is #{name} and I'm #{age} years old."
```

Output:

```text
My name is Alice and I'm 30 years old.
```

## Formatting output

For more complex formatting, you can use the `printf` method or string formatting:

```ruby
# Using printf
printf("Pi is approximately %.2f\n", Math::PI)

# Using string formatting
puts "Pi is approximately %.2f" % Math::PI
```

Output:

```text
Pi is approximately 3.14
Pi is approximately 3.14
```

These methods provide various ways to print output in Ruby, allowing you to choose the most appropriate one for your specific needs.
