# Printing in Ruby

Ruby provides several methods for outputting text to the console. This document covers the most common ways to print in Ruby, including `puts`, `print`, `p`, string interpolation, and formatting output.

## Using `puts`

The `puts` method prints the given object(s) to the console, followed by a newline character.

```ruby
puts "Hello, World!"
# Output: Hello, World!

name = "Alice"
puts "Hello, #{name}!"
# Output: Hello, Alice!

puts 42
# Output: 42
```

## Using `print`

The `print` method is similar to `puts`, but it doesn't add a newline character at the end.

```ruby
print "Hello, "
print "World!"
# Output: Hello, World!

name = "Bob"
print "Hello, "
print name
print "!"
# Output: Hello, Bob!
```

## Using `p`

The `p` method prints an object's inspected version, which can be useful for debugging.

```ruby
p "Hello, World!"
# Output: "Hello, World!"

array = [1, 2, 3]
p array
# Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

## Using string interpolation

You can use string interpolation with any of the above methods to include variables or expressions within a string.

```ruby
name = "Charlie"
age = 30

puts "My name is #{name} and I'm #{age} years old."
# Output: My name is Charlie and I'm 30 years old.
```

## Formatting output

For more complex formatting, you can use the `printf` method or string formatting with the `%` operator.

```ruby
# Using printf
printf("Name: %s, Age: %d\n", "David", 25)
# Output: Name: David, Age: 25

# Using string formatting
format = "Name: %s, Age: %d"
puts format % ["Eve", 28]
# Output: Name: Eve, Age: 28
```

These methods provide various ways to print output in Ruby, allowing you to choose the most appropriate one for your specific needs.
